Understanding What CSS Is and How It Works with HTML
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the look and format of a document written in HTML. It's what makes the web look good.

Why CSS?
CSS allows for a consistent look across multiple web pages, controls the layout of multiple pages at once, and provides a way to set presentation characteristics.

Understanding the Syntax of CSS
The syntax for CSS is straightforward:

selector {
  property: value;
}

How to Add CSS
External CSS: Link an external .css file within your HTML.
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
Internal CSS: Place CSS in a <style> tag within the <head> section of your HTML.
<style>
p {
  color: red;
}
</style>
Inline CSS: Apply styles directly with the style attribute of HTML elements.
<p style="color: blue;">This is a paragraph.</p>
